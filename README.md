Online Sales Analysis â€“ Task 6

This project performs a monthly sales trend analysis on the Online Sales Dataset from a popular marketplace. Using SQLite and Python, the analysis calculates monthly revenue and order volume. Visualizations include line and bar charts for revenue and orders, and a combined chart for both metrics. The insights highlight seasonal peaks, high-value orders, and trends useful for sales forecasting, promotions, and inventory planning. All SQL scripts, data, and Jupyter notebooks are included.
